In May of 2005, I started a pilgrimage to transform myself into a
doctor of engineering. Little did I know, then, that my journey would
bring me in touch with some of the most creative, vibrant and
inspiring minds in the open source world, and that an opportunity
would arise to help realise their (and now my) dream: a completely
free and open environment for performing cutting edge science. In this
talk, I take you on my journey, and along the way introduce the NumPy
and SciPy projects, our community, the early days of packaging, our
documentation project, the publication of conference proceedings as
well as work-shops and sprints around the world. I may even tell you a
bit about my PhD on super-resolution imaging!
